# CalSPEED for Android Redesign

### CSU Monterey Bay 
### CST 499 - Capstone
### Spring 2021


We developed a new UI for California Public Utility Commissionâ€™s CalSpeed Android app which allows a user to do multiple tests including mobile data download, upload speeds, the ping etc. We made the app more engaging by adding animated visual cues which inform the user how the speed test is progressing. We also took a minimal approach to the layout of the app to reduce the amount of information displayed on the screen unless the user interacts with the app.
